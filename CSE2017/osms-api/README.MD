# OSMS-API

Simple API to partially implement 4 sample functionalities of an Online Shopping Management System.

- API Endpoint 1: {url}/api/users/administrators/login 
- API Endpoint 2: {url}/api/users/customers/login 
- API Endpoint 3: {url}/api/users/customers/signup 
- API Endpoint 4: {url}/api/catalogue

{url} can be replaced with https://cse2017-osms.herokuapp.com

The project has been written using the Java Servlets API and is deployed to the [Heroku PaaS platform](https://heroku.com/) so that it can be tested using API testing tools like [Postman](https://getpostman.com/).
