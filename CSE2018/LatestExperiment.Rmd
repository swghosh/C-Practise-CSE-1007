```{r}
library(datasets)
data("mtcars")
```

Q1. Find out the `cyl` and `am` variable in `mtcars` dataset have a strong correlation (use chi square test) null hypothesis: they are correlated or not, find out.

```{r}
cars_cyl <- mtcars$cyl
cars_am <- mtcars$am
table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$am)
#chisq.test(cars_cyl, cars_am)
```

Q2. Find out the relationship between `mpg` and `cyl`.

```{r}
cars_mpg <- mtcars$mpg
cars_cyl <- mtcars$cyl
cor(cars_mpg, cars_cyl)
```

Q3. Use T test to find the influence `mpg` and `am`.

```{r}
batch_at <- subset(mtcars, am == 0)$mpg
batch_at
batch_mt <- subset(mtcars, am == 1)$mpg
batch_mt

t.test(batch_at, batch_mt)
```

Use chisql.test(), t.test() functions.
